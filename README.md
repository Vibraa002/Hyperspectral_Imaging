# Hyperspectral_Imaging
This project presents a linear unmixing pipeline for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis, aimed at identifying pure spectral signatures (endmembers) from mixed pixels in hyperspectral data. The approach integrates Vertex Component Analysis (VCA) for endmember extraction and Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) for abundance estimation.
